# divcode
Simple web page for an organization in the tech industry wants to get new insights into their training programs, industry trends, and prospects performances
<h3>How the page works</h3>
<p>There is dummy data in a Traings.xlsx file which can be used to test out the code. The file contains data with the following headers
<ul>
<li>Training Name</li>
<li>Development Stack</li>
<li>Start Date</li>
<li>Duration</li>
<li>Trainer</li>
<li>Link-Link to training logo/image</li>
<li>Price</li>
</ul>
These are filtered based on the stack which is selected in the input field. 
</p>
<p>Also a pagination with 12 training items  per page was set. You could edit the number of items on a page in the javascript file. </p>
<h3>Try it Out</h3>
<p>You can visit the<a href="https://marthateye.github.io/divcode/index.html"> link</a> to test out the site</p>
<p>Download the data sample on the page and upload that file using the file upload.</p>
<p>Wait for the page to load and now you can filter using the filter drop down.</p>
<p>Send me an email if there are any inputs or suggestions. <a href="mailto:martha.teye9@gmail.com">Send mail</a></p>
<p>NB: More updates would be pushed when ready</p>
